# react-winjs Movies

This example demonstrates a couple of `react-winjs` components in a small app for looking up movies. See it in action [here](http://winjs.github.io/react-winjs/examples/movies/index.html).

It is inspired by the [react-native movies example](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Examples/Movies).
